Download and read through the Matlab speech2text Toolbox before using this code!! The examples portion is extremely helpful. I personally used
IBM's speech to text tool because it is free for the most minutes per month, but you can use the tool of your preference. 

Also! With regards to the .json file, please put your personal URL from the website inside, so it does not interfere with mine.
